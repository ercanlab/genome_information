# genome_information
Files that contain regions of interest, or specific subsets of the annotated genome. These are reference files used by our scripts. 

These files will be specific to the C. elegans WS220 (ce10) genome build, unless otherwise stated.

## celegans_ws220_GATC_digest.bed
This is a bed file with the posistion of every single GATC in the C. elegans genome. The position is given as the the two nucleotides A and T. GATC is the target site for digestion by DpnII and MboI, which are both used in chromosome conformation capture approaches.  

## celegans_ws220_AAGCTT_digest.bed
This is a bed file with the posistion of every single AAGCTT in the C. elegans genome. The position is given as the the two nucleotides G and C. AAGCTT is the target site for digestion by HindIII, which is used in chromosome conformation capture approaches.
